## üìá Project Description

This project was created to find famous Black authors that often go un-noticed. In honor of Juneteenth we would like everyone around the word to add their famous black authors. You can search up black authors, and some of the books they've written, as well as add black authors, and the books they have written. This project was created with a monolithic approach utilizing spring boot and its modules.

## üìù User Stories 

As a user I should be able to create an Author in the database.

As a user I should be able to look up a single author.

As a user I should be able to update a single author.

As a user I should be able to delete a single author.

As a user I should be able to create a book for a single author.

As a user I should be able to update a book that belongs to a single author.

As a user I should be able to delete a book that belongs to a single author.

As a user I should be able to delete a single author.

As a user, Im able to get a list of authors from my database so I can find different books from the authors.

As a user I should not be allowed to make duplicate entries of authors. If I should make a duplicate entry of an author an error should immediately come across the screen, so I don‚Äôt input that duplicate.

## Reflections / Hurdles / Wins 
One thing I would do differently if I was given another project with a similar outcome is to really spend time learning, and familiarizing myself with the material I am not comfortable with FIRST. During the project there were a few concepts that were hazy to me, but I was able to search for different methods/ways to properly implement those things into my project successfully. I was learning as I went through with the project which was great, but I feel like that took up a lot of my time, and I wasn‚Äôt as confident.


I am most proud of the fact that I took this project as a learning experience. Anything I was not comfortable with I spent more time on. I asked more questions about it, and diligently completed research to successfully find the answer. I was more comfortable with the cucumber version of testing, so I went ahead and completed the testing utilizing the MVC. After completing so many test cases utilizing the MVC approach I grew more comfortable with the material.


One thing I would do next is implement a synopsis of each book.So if views are not familiar with the book titles the have more information to gauge their selection. I would also implement a small auto-biography of each author. Just some general facts of where they are from, when they began writing, and when was their first publish.


I learned a lot about how to properly utilize MVC. I know it‚Äôs something simple to most, but for me I had a tuff time properly obtaining, and inserting information in Postman. During this project I got the opportunity to successfully test all of my endpoints. {Before it was successful, I had a lot of hiccups} This is not tech related, but I learned a lot about 60% of these authors. I had never heard of some of these authors before, but I have read some of their books, I just never connected the author with the book. It was fun to actually learn some non-tech information doing this project as well.

## üîñ Credits 
Thank you so much to Wanda, she helped me understand what I was doing better, and she helped me refactor my project where it needed refactoring. Wanda also was sure to explain her thought process on any refactoring she wanted me to implment. 

Thank you to group RC {Rachel & Clair} They were the support system that I needed during this project.
