As a user I should be able to update a single author.

As a user I should be able to delete a single author.

As a user I should be able to create a book for a single author.

As a user I should be able to update a book that belongs to a single author.

As a user I should be able to delete a book that belongs to a single author.

As a user I should be able to delete a single author.

As a user, Im able to get a list of authors from my database so I can find different books from the authors.

As a user I should not be allowed to make duplicate entries of authors. If I should make a duplicate entry of an author an error should immediately come across the screen, so I don‚Äôt input that duplicate.

As a user, I'm able to get one single author illustrating the name of the book, and the description with the isbn number.
